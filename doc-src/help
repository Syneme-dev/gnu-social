The Artsmesh: Network Music is a microblog. Users post brief status updates, bookmarks or events to networks of individuals or subscribed-to groups.

First register a new account. Then, on the public timeline, enter your message into the textbox at the top of the page, and click "Send". It will go out on the public timeline and to anyone who is subscribed to your notices.

To subscribe to other people's notifications, go to their profile page and click the "subscribe" button. They'll get a notice that you're now subscribed to their notifications.

OpenID
------------------------------

The Artsmesh: Network Music supports the OpenID standard for single sign-ons between Web sites. OpenID lets you log into many different Web sites without using a different password for each.

If you already have an account on The Artsmesh: Network Music, you can login with your username and password as usual. To use OpenID in the future, you can add an OpenID to your account after you’ve logged in normally.

There are many Public OpenID providers, and you may already have an OpenID-enabled account on another service, such as gmail or twitter.

Also, once you have an account on Artsmesh.io, you can use your profile's URL (http://artsmesh.io/yourusername) as an OpenID elsewhere as well.

Tags
------------------------------

The Artsmesh: Network Music supports tags to help organize your posts. You can use tags for messages and people.

Tagging a notice

You can tag a notice by using the hashtag ‘#' character followed by letters and numbers as well as '.', '-', and '_’. For example: #music or #net-music.

The tag will then link to a stream of all the other notices with that same tag. You may subscribe to a tag stream and be notified when a notice is posted with that tag.

Tagging yourself

You can also add tags for yourself on your profile settings page or by using the edit tags button on your profile page. Use single words to describe yourself or your interests. The tags will become links on your profile page to a list of all other users on the site who also use that tag. In this way you can find people who are related to you by interest.

Tagging others

You can also tag other users by using the edit tags button next to their profile. Such tags are called people tags. Once you have created a people tag, you can add or remove users from it using the tag's edit form. This makes it easy to organize your subscriptions into groups and sort through them separately. Also, it will let you create custom lists of people that others can subscribe to.

You can also send a notice "to the attention of" your subscribers whom you've marked with a particular tag (note: not people who've marked themselves with that tag). "@#family hello" will send a notice to all your subscribers you've marked with the tag 'family'.

Private and public people tags

A private people tag is only visible to the creator, it cannot be subscribed to, but the timeline can be viewed. To create a new private people tag prepend a '.' to the tag in the tags editing box. To set an existing public tag as private or vice-versa, go to the tag's edit page.

Groups
------------------------------

Users of Artsmesh: Network Music can create groups that other users can join. Groups are a way to share information between project members, networked music ensembles and their fans, research teams or genre focused groups.

You can find groups on the Groups page. You can join a group by clicking the "Join" button either in the group list or on the group's home page.

Starting a new group

You can start a new group for friends and colleagues. Note that groups can be public or private.

To start a new group, use the new group tool and fill out the form. Describe the group.

When choosing a nickname for your group, try to keep it short. The nickname is often included in messages to and from the group, so the less chars the better.

Sending messages to a group

You can send a message to a group using the syntax "!groupname" anywhere in the message. If you have more than one group named in such a way, the notice will go to each group. Only members can send notices to a group, and groups do not respond to direct messages (DMs).

You can also select the group from the "To:" drop down when posting.

You can make a group message private by clicking the "private" button before posting.

Receiving messages

New group messages will appear in your inbox.

Private groups

The creator/admin of a group can make a group private. For a private group, all notices will be sent privately to group members only. Also, group admins will need to approve all new members to the group.

Private groups are visible in the group directory.

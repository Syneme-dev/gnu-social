%%site.name%% is a **social service**. Users can post short
(%%site.textlimit%% character) status messages which are broadcast to
their friends and colleagues on the service and (optionally) onto the Web.

You can also broadcast other types of data, like bookmarks, event
invitations, polls, and questions.

If you'd like to try it out, first [register](%%action.register%%) a new account.
Then, on the [public timeline](%%action.top%%), enter your message into
the textbox at the top of the page, and click "Send". It will go out on the
public timeline and to anyone who is subscribed to your notices.

To subscribe to other people's notifications, go to their profile page
and click the "subscribe" button. They'll get a notice that you're now
subscribed to their notifications.

OpenID
------------------------------

%%site.name%% supports the [OpenID](http://openid.net/) standard for single signon between Web sites. OpenID lets you log into many different Web sites without using a different password for each. (See [Wikipedia's OpenID article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID) for more information.)

If you already have an account on %%site.name%%, you can [login](%%action.login%%) with your username and password as usual.
To use OpenID in the future, you can [add an OpenID to your account](%%action.openidsettings%%) after you have logged in normally.

There are many [Public OpenID providers](http://wiki.openid.net/OpenID-Providers), and you may already have an OpenID-enabled account on another service.

* On wikis: If you have an account on an OpenID-enabled wiki, like [Wikitravel](http://wikitravel.org/), [wikiHow](http://www.wikihow.com/), [Vinismo](http://vinismo.com/), [AboutUs](http://aboutus.org/) or [Keiki](http://kei.ki/), you can log in to %%site.name%% by entering the **full URL** of your user page on that other wiki in the box above. For example, *http://kei.ki/en/User:Evan*.
* [Yahoo!](http://openid.yahoo.com/) : If you have an account with Yahoo!, you can log in to this site by entering your Yahoo!-provided OpenID in the box above. Yahoo! OpenID URLs have the form *https://me.yahoo.com/yourusername*.
* [AOL](http://dev.aol.com/aol-and-63-million-openids) : If you have an account with [AOL](http://www.aol.com/), like an [AIM](http://www.aim.com/) account, you can log in to %%site.name%% by entering your AOL-provided OpenID in the box above. AOL OpenID URLs have the form *http://openid.aol.com/yourusername*. Your username should be all lowercase, no spaces.
* [Blogger](http://bloggerindraft.blogspot.com/2008/01/new-feature-blogger-as-openid-provider.html), [Wordpress.com](http://faq.wordpress.com/2007/03/06/what-is-openid/), [LiveJournal](http://www.livejournal.com/openid/about.bml), [Vox](http://bradfitz.vox.com/library/post/openid-for-vox.html) : If you have a blog on any of these services, enter your blog URL in the box above. For example, *http://yourusername.blogspot.com/*, *http://yourusername.wordpress.com/*, *http://yourusername.livejournal.com/*, or *http://yourusername.vox.com/*.

Additionally, once you have an account on %%site.name%%, you can use your profile's URL (https://%%site.server%%/yourusername) as an OpenID elsewhere as well.

Tags

%%site.name%% supports
[tags](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_(metadata)) to help you
organize your activities here. You can use tags for people and for
notices.

***Tagging a notice***

You can tag a notice using a *hashtag*; a # character followed by
letters and numbers as well as '.', '-', and '_'. Note that accented
latin characters are not supported, and non-roman scripts are right out.

The HTML for the notice will link to a stream of all the other notices
with that tag. This can be a great way to keep track of a conversation.

***Tagging yourself***

You can also add tags for yourself on your [profile
settings](%%action.profilesettings%%) page or by using the edit tags
button on your profile page. Use single words to
describe yourself, your experiences and your interest. The tags will
become links on your profile page to a list of all the users on the
site who use that same tag. It can be a nice way to find people who
are related to you geographically or who have a common interest.

***Tagging others***

You can also tag other users by using the edit tags button next to
their profile. Such tags are called *people tags*. Once you have
created a people tag, you can add or remove users from it using the
tag's edit form. This makes it easy to organize your subscriptions
into groups and sort through them separately. Also, it will let
you create custom lists of people that others can subscribe to.

You can also send a notice "to the attention of" your subscribers
whom you've marked with a particular tag (note: *not* people who've
marked themselves with that tag). "@#family hello" will send a
notice to all your subscribers you've marked with the tag 'family'.

***Private and public people tags***

A private people tag is only visible to the creator, it cannot be
subscribed to, but the timeline can be viewed. To create a new
private prepend a '.' to the tag in the tags editing box. To set
an existing public tag as private or vice-versa, go to the tag's
edit page.

Groups

Users on %%site.name%% can create *groups* that other users can join.
Groups can be a great way to share information and entertainment with
a group of people who have a common interest or background; who work
together on a team; or who have a particular knowledge or skill.

You can find out about groups on the server on the
[Groups](%%action.groups%%) page. You can join a group by clicking on
the "Join" button either in the group list or on the group's home page.

***Starting a new group***

You can start a new group for friends and colleagues. Note that all
groups are free for anyone to join.

To start a new group, use the [new group](%%action.newgroup%%) tool
and fill out the form. Describe your group as best you can if you want
people to be able to find it.

When choosing the nickname for your group, try to keep it short. The
nickname is sometimes included in messages to and from the group, so
the less chars the better. Try using acronyms for organizations, or
airport codes for places (like 'pdx' instead of 'portland').

***Sending messages to a group***

You can send a message to a group using the syntax "!groupname"
anywhere in the message. If you have more than one group named, the
notice will go to each group. Only members can send notices to a
group, and groups do not respond to direct messages (DMs).

You can also select the group from the "To:" drop down when posting.

You can make a group message private by clicking the "private" button
before posting.

***Receiving messages***

New group messages will appear in your inbox, and will also come to
your phone or IM client if you've set them up to receive notices.

***Private groups***

The administrator can make a group private. For a private group, all
notices will marked as private for group members only. Also,
administrators will have to approve all new members to the group.

Private groups are visible in the group directory.

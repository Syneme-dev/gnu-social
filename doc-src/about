This site is the main microblogging service for The Artsmesh: a network of music studios connected by high-speed networks, engaged in the practice of network music performance (NMP).

We provide this server as an initial convenience (on-ramp) for the Artsmesh user, though the mesh is designed to be a decentralized, federated network and we encourage you to run a themed version of GNU Social [link: https://www.gnu.org/software/social] on your own server. 
Alternatively we provide a service to host your own solo site on one of our Linodes located in a region of your choice.

The Artsmesh is accessed through an application called Artsmesh [link: /group/artsmesh]: a Pro-Presence tool - developed jointly by Syneme [linked to: /group/syneme] and the Detao Artsmesh Studio [link to: /group/detao] in Beijing. Beta release scheduled for Sept/2014.

Artsmesh is a Network-User Interface (NUI): routing audio/video via Jack and Syphon frameworks, network testing and visualization, user/group management/merging (CoreOS/ETCD clusters); making live multi-site network music performances DIY simple.

If you would like to participate, please contact Syneme: syneme.lab@gmail.com.

The Artsmesh app and site are both enbled for IPV6

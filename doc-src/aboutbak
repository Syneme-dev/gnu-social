This is a social network, running the GNU social software.

You can use it to make connections between friends, family and
colleagues -- writing short notices about yourself, where you are, and
what you're doing, and those notices will be sent to all your contacts.

In the future, we'll be adding support for photo, video and file
sharing, as well as events, better contact management and mobile
devices.

social network based on the Free Software [GNU social](http://www.gnu.org/software/social/) tool.

about yourself, where you are, what you're doing, or practically

friends, or other people you're interested in, and follow them on the
Web or in an [RSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) feed.

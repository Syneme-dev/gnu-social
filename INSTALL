Prerequisites
=============

The following software packages are *required* for this software to
run correctly.

- PHP 5.3.2+    For newer versions, some functions that are used may be
                disabled by default, such as the pcntl_* family. See the
                section on 'Queues and daemons' for more information.
- MariaDB 5.x   GNU Social uses, by default, a MariaDB server for data
                storage. Versions 5.x and 10.x have both reportedly
                worked well. It is also possible to run MySQL 5.x.
- Web server    Apache, lighttpd and nginx will all work. CGI mode is
                recommended and also some variant of 'suexec' (or a
                proper setup php-fpm pool)
                NOTE: mod_rewrite or its equivalent is extremely useful.

Your PHP installation must include the following PHP extensions for a
functional setup of GNU Social:

- Curl          Fetching files by HTTP.
- XMLWriter     For formatting XML and HTML output.
- mysqlnd       The native driver for PHP5 MariaDB connections. If you
                use MySQL, 'mysql' or 'mysqli' may work.
- GD            Image manipulation (scaling).
- mbstring      For handling Unicode (UTF-8) encoded strings.
- bcmath or gmp For Salmon signatures (part of OStatus)


Installation
============

1. clone source from git hub.
   go to destination web server path and run command
   git clone git@github.com:Syneme-dev/gnu-social.git


2. Make your target directory writeable by the Web server.

       chmod a+w /var/www/gnusocial/
       chmod a+w /var/www/gnusocial/avatar
       chmod a+w /var/www/gnusocial/background
       chmod a+w /var/www/gnusocial/file

3. Create a database to hold your site data. Something like this
   should work:

       mysqladmin -u "root" --password="rootpassword" create gnusocial


4. Create a new database account that GNU Social will use to access the
   database. If you have shell access, this will probably work from the
   MariaDB shell:

       GRANT ALL on gnusocial.*
       TO 'gnusocial'@'localhost'
       IDENTIFIED BY 'agoodpassword';

   You should change the user identifier 'gnusocial' and 'agoodpassword'
   to your preferred new database username and password. You may want to
   test logging in to MariaDB as this new user.

5. In a browser, navigate to the GNU Social install script; something like:

       http://social.example.net/install.php

   Enter the database connection information and your site name. The
   install program will configure your site and install the initial,
   almost-empty database.

6. You should now be able to navigate to your social site's main directory
   and see the "Public Timeline", which will probably be empty. You can
   now register new user, post some notices, edit your profile, etc.

7. config artsmesh site using dark theme.
   edit the generate config.php on the root path of the web site.
   $config['site']['theme'] = 'dark';
